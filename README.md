# data-512-final

My main motivation of this project is to find any patterns that I can find in covid deaths when it comes to ethnicity, gender and counties.

I think this is important because this will help us provide more better facilities to the people who are more needy. This will also allow other interested researchers to dig in deeper and try to see if there are any inherent issues on why these patterns might exist.

I hope to learn more about the data science process like data joining, cleaning and presenting them in the most understandable way.
